# DSST Locations

Testing centers for DSST (Dantes) tests are listed here: http://getcollegecredit.com/institutions/search. However, there is no map. These set of scripts automates the download and processing of this data, so the addresses can be geolocated and displayed on a map. 

To understand the basic processes and the structure of the data, look at data.py in spikes. This was the first attempt and resulted in about 1000 out of 11000 locations correctly parsed and geocoded (Geocoding through manual batch upload to https://geoservices.tamu.edu/).
